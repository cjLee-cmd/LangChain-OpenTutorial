    "### **What is Self-RAG?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-RAG** is a RAG strategy that includes additional steps to check and verify both the retrieved documents and the generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional RAG, the main process was for the LLM to generate answers based on the retrieved information. In Self-RAG, through **self-evaluation**, the following points are verified:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determining the need for retrieval: Determine whether additional retrieval is needed for the current question.\n",
    "2. Evaluating the relevance of retrieval results: Check whether the retrieved document chunks are helpful in solving the question.\n",
    "3. Verifying the factuality of the response: Evaluate whether the generated response is sufficiently supported by the provided document chunks.\n",
    "4. Evaluating the quality of the response: Measure whether the generated response actually solves the question well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, beyond simply retrieving and generating answers, the quality and factuality of the generated responses can be self-monitored and improved.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Input: `x (question)`, `d (chunk)`, `y (generation)` for each `d` in `D`\n",
